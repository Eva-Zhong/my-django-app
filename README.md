To run the website, type "python manage.py runserver" in the console, and then go to the link (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) given.

The web is deployed also in an online host, pythonanywhere (http://carlofficehour.pythonanywhere.com/). It uses a different database so it won't display 
exactly the same contents as the local host did. Except for the database, all the other changes in local files can be pushed into the remote host and updated 
on the remote site hosted by Pythonanywhere.

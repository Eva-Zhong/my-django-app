# my-django-app

To run the website, type "python manage.py runserver" in the console, and then go to the link (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) given.
To make local changes to the content, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin (please contact me for account and password), and then
add new posts in the admin page. New contents will automatically be synced to the site. 

The web is deployed also in an online host, pythonanywhere (http://carlofficehour.pythonanywhere.com/). It uses a different database so it won't display exactly the same contents as the local host did. Except for the database, all the other changes in local files can be pushed into the remote host and updated on the remote site hosted by Pythonanywhere. 
To make changes to the remote site, go to http://carlofficehour.pythonanywhere.com/admin, log in, and make your edits to the contents.
